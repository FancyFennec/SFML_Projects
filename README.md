# SFML_Projects
This repository contains a nubmer of small projects that use [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/).
# How to set-up the project
Download the [SFML SDK](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php) and put them into a folder named SFML next to the project's folder. Make sure that the project you want to run is [configured correctly](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-vc.php).
# The Projects
## DrawingApp
This is the main application is was working on with SFML. The initial idea was to create a drawing app where you can draw with normals and different materials. It turned oyt that drawing with normals is not as pleasant as I imagined :D
## FlowerGenerator
## HeightMapGenerator
## LSystems
And implementation of [LSystems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system) with SFML.
## Mandelbrot
My first attempt at drawing the Mandelbrot set with SFML. It is running entirely on the CPU.
## OpenClMandelbrot
My second attempt at drawing the Mandelbrot set with SFML. It uses OpenCl.
## PathFindingExperiments
First attempts at path finding. This is an implementation of the A* algorithm
## PerlinNoise
